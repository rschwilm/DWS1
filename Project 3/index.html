	<h2 id="info"> General Information </h2> <!-- first section -->
	<p> Health is defined as "a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being" by <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr>. Many people want to be healthy, but they just aren't sure what to do. Malnutrition, disease, and poor life style choices are the prime reasons for lack of health in today's society. <strong>Thankfully, with proper diet, exercise, and all-natural supplements it is easy to stay in optimum health.</strong> </p>
	
	
	<h2 id="diet"> Diet </h2> <!-- second section -->
	<p> A healthy diet is one that helps maintain or improve overall health. A healthy diet supports energy needs and provides for human nutrition without exposure to toxicity or excessive weight gain from consuming excessive amounts. Where lack of calories is not an issue, a properly balanced diet (in addition to exercise) is also thought to be important for lowering health risks, such as obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cancer. Various nutrition guides are published by medical and governmental institutions to educate the public on what they should be eating to promote health. Nutrition facts labels are also mandatory in some countries to allow consumers to choose between foods based on the components relevant to health. An easy way to keep from eating unhealthy foods regularly? Buy fresh ingredients and cook meals at home. It is much easier said then done, but is worth the effort. </p>

	<h2 id="exer"> Exercise </h2><!-- third section -->
	<p> Physical exercise is any bodily activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness. It is performed for various reasons, including strengthening muscles and the cardiovascular system, honing athletic skills, weight loss or maintenance, and merely enjoyment. Frequent and regular physical exercise boosts the immune system and helps prevent the "diseases of affluence" such as heart disease, cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, and obesity. It may also help prevent depression, help to promote or maintain positive self-esteem, improve mental health generally, and can augment an individual's sex appeal or body image, which has been found to be linked with higher levels of self-esteem. Childhood obesity is a growing global concern, and physical exercise may help decrease some of the effects of childhood and adult obesity. Health care providers often call exercise the "miracle" or "wonder" drugâ€”alluding to the wide variety of proven benefits that it can provide. </p>

	<h3> Vitamins </h3> <!-- first section of supplements -->
	<p> Vitamin is an organic compound required by an organism as a vital nutrient in limited amounts. An organic chemical compound (or related set of compounds) is called a vitamin when it cannot be synthesized in sufficient quantities by an organism, and must be obtained from the diet. Thus, the term is conditional both on the circumstances and on the particular organism. For example, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is a vitamin for humans, but not for most other animals. Supplementation is important for the treatment of certain health problems but there is little evidence of benefit when used by those who are otherwise healthy. </p>
	<h3> Herbal Medicines </h3> <!-- second section of supplements  -->
	<p> Herbal medicine is the use of plants for medicinal purposes. Plants have been the basis for medical treatments through much of human history, and such traditional medicine is still widely practiced today. Modern medicine recognizes herbalism as a form of alternative medicine, as the practice of herbalism is not strictly based on evidence gathered using the scientific method. Modern medicine, does, however, make use of many plant-derived compounds as the basis for evidence-tested pharmaceutical drugs, and phytotherapy works to apply modern standards of effectiveness testing to herbs and medicines that are derived from natural sources. The scope of herbal medicine is sometimes extended to include fungal and bee products, as well as minerals, shells and certain animal parts. </p>
